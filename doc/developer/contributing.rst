Tagging conventions
-------------------

This project uses two tag namespaces:

- Version tags (for packaging): ``vX.Y`` or ``vX.Y.Z`` (e.g., ``v0.2.1``)
- Ops tags (for deployment bookmarks): any non-version tag (e.g., ``ops/mfr_raw2netcdf/2026-02-02``)

Only version tags are used to infer the package version during builds.
