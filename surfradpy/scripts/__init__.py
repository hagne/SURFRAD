This subpackage is supposed to contain the script backends. Since I moved to the
"pip install -e" installation methode scripts are no longer in edit mode, so a
reinstall would be required if changes are made to the script itself. Therefore, 
the scripts are simply pointing to modules here, which continue to be editable.
